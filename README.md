# About this Repo

This is the Git repo of the official Docker image for [distribution](https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/registry/).
See the Hub page for the full readme on how to use the Docker image and for information
regarding contributing and issues.

**NOTE:**

This fork of the official docker registry is used to publish a `registry`
using `alpine:3.13` as the base image. This improves compatibily with
other tools (specifically the python cryptography library).
